# house-price-predection-and-recommendation
Jupyter Notebook named housing.ipynb.
The notebook contains a Housing Dataset and a Price prediction & House Recommendation System.
The dataset consists of 7 columns and 5000 rows.
The columns are Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms, Area Population, Price, and Address.


# introduction
Welcome to my house prediction model! In this project, I aim to predict the price of a house based on a variety of features. To accomplish this, I have used a dataset containing information on 5000 houses, including their average area income, average area house age, average area number of rooms, average area number of bedrooms, area population, price, and address.

I have selected these features because they are known to be important factors in determining the price of a house. To make my predictions, I have used a machine learning algorithm called linear regression. This algorithm works by finding the best line that fits the data, allowing me to make accurate predictions about the price of a house based on its features.
